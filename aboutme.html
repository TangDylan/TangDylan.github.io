        </h1>
        <p font-size=12px>Hello! My name is Dylan Tang and I aspire to become a computer scientist! I have always wanted to be involved in technology and computer science. I plan on reaching my aspirations through consistent work and persistence. I will strive to make my work the best it can be and to learn as much as I can. I have been inspired by many pioneers in technology such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. These idols inspire me to create something amazing in the technological world that we live in today.</p>
        <br>
        <p> I am a self-motivated person. Whenever I face a challenge, I always know that I can persevere and overcome it. I motivate myself to take difficult classes and to push myself further everyday. </p>

          About Me
        </h1>
        <p font-size=12px>Hello! My name is Dylan Tang and I aspire to become a computer scientist! I have always wanted to be involved in technology and computer science. I plan on reaching my aspirations through consistent work and persistence. I will strive to make my work the best it can be and to learn as much as I can. I have been inspired by many pioneers in technology such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. These idols inspire me to create something amazing in the technological world that we live in today.</p>
        <br>
        <p> I am a self-motivated person. Whenever I face a challenge, I always know that I can persevere and overcome it. I motivate myself to take difficult classes and to push myself further everyday. I am also persistent. I truly try my hardest on a challenging task, and I do not give up very easily. I also love to learn! I love to try new things such as learning a new language or playing a different instrument. I am fairly involved in music and I can play more than 5 instruments.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of my greatest achievements in high school was getting straight A's my freshman year. It was truly a real challenge to manage my time as I had many extracurricular activities, such as marching band and the Interact Club. I enjoy extracurricular activities because they allow me to work on something I enjoy with my classmates and friends. Another achievement was getting a 5 on my AP Human Geography test. Last year was an especially hard test; the most challenging one that they have had in a decade. I was surprised to see that I did very well on it, which motivated me to continue to challenge myself. Performing well on assessments and during music concerts show that I can efficiently translate my hard work into results. I can succeed in a class through hard work and by being attentive. Through practice and motivation, I believe that I can succeed in my classes and be able to enjoy my journey.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Overall, I am a avid learner and someone who enjoys a good challenge. I have an amazing passion for computers and computer science, and I can not wait for what the future holds for me! Thanks for checking out my first webpage! Please explore the rest of my site and contact me for any feedback you may have! I am always willing to learn how I can improve my skills.</p>

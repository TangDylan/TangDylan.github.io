        <p>I go to Palm Desert High School, which resides in Palm Desert, California. So far, I have attended 9th grade there and am currently in 10th grade. Some classes I have taken or taking are AP Human Geography, COD Chemistry, and AP World History. I am interested in going to college after I graduate high school.

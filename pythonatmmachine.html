        <p>During the process of creating this Python ATM Machine, my group and I encountered problems and discovered more about our coding abilities. One problem that we encountered was problems in communication. There were many times where someone would be running the code and someone else would be modifying the code, resulting in the program not functioning as intended. This was solved through methodical and collaborative discussion, with one person running the code at a time and the rest giving advice/opinions. We also had problems with the while loop, as certain lines of code would repeat too many times or not appear at all. We broke down every single line of code to evaluate its purpose and realized that some aspects of the while loop could be executed through an if statement. For myself, I learned that defining a function could allow us to implement the user to create an account for the Python ATM Machine. This individual innovation helped the program be more unique and advanced. </p>
